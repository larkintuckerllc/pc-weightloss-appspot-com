Mobile Web Application for Physician's Choice Weightloss


This mobile web application is designed to replace a pen-and-paper food and exercise logging system used by Physician's Choice Weightloss at a number of physical therapy clinics.

This client-side code is provided as an example of building a mobile web application interacting with server-side RESTful services (server-side code not provided).


KEY FEATURES

The key features of this web application are:

* Designed primarily for mobile devices but works just fine in any modern desktop browser.

* Application (HTML5 cache manifest) caching for quick loading.

* Lazy data loading using the Backbone-relational JavaScript library.


DEPENDENCIES

Meeting App is developed upon the following JavaScript libraries.

* Backbone.js (backbone.js): Provides a lightweight model-view-controller (MVC) framework.

* Backbone-relational (backbone-relational.js): Extension to Backbone.js to support relations between models.

* JQuery (jquery.js): "It makes things like HTML document traversal and manipulation, event handling, animation, and Ajax much simpler..."

* JQuery Mobile (jquery.mobile.js): Provides a robust mobile friendly user interface.

* Mustache.js (mustache.js): Templating library to separate HTML/CSS code from the JavaScript code.

* RequireJS (require.js): File/module loader to improve the readabilty and performance of JavaScript code.

* Underscore.js (underscore.js): "Underscore is a utility-belt library for JavaScript that provides a lot of the functional programming support..." 

These Javascript libraries and accompanying files are expected to be stored as follows:
